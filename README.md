<br>
For this project, you will build a a system for face recognition and gender classification, and test it on a large(-ish) dataset of faces, getting practice with data-science-flavour projects along the way. You may import things like numpy and matplotlib , but the idea is to implement things “from scratch”: you may not import libraries that will do your work for you!

The input

You will work with a subset of the <u><a href="http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html">FaceScrub </a></u>dataset. The subset of male actors is <u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/facescrub_actors.txt">here </a></u>and the subset of female actors is <u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/facescrub_actresses.txt">here </a></u>. The dataset consists of URLs of images with faces, as well as the bounding boxes of the faces. The format of the bounding box is as follows (from the FaceScrub readme.txt file):

<strong>The format is x1,y1,x2,y2, where (x1,y1) is the coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box and (x2,y2) is that of the bottom-right corner, with (0,0) as the top-left corner of the image. Assuming the image is represented as a Python NumPy array I, a face in I can be obtained as I[y1:y2, x1:x2].</strong>

You may find it helpful to use and/or modify <u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/get_data.py">my script </a></u>for downloading the image data.

At first, you should work with the faces of the following actors: <strong>act</strong> =[‘Fran Drescher’, ‘America Ferrera’, ‘Kristin Chenoweth’, ‘Alec Baldwin’, ‘Bill Hader’, ‘Steve Carell’]

For this project, you should crop out the images of the faces, convert them to grayscale, and resize them to 32×32 before proceeding further. You should use scipy.misc.imresize to scale images, and you can use <u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/rgb2gray.py">r</a></u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/rgb2gray.py">g</a><u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/rgb2gray.py">b2</a></u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/rgb2gray.py">g</a><u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/rgb2gray.py">ray </a></u><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/411/proj1/rgb2gray.py">t</a>o convert RGB images to grayscale images.

Part 1

Describe the dataset of faces. In particular, provide at least three examples of the images in the dataset, as well as at least three examples of cropped out faces. Comment on the quality of the annotation of the dataset: are the bounding boxes accurate? Can the cropped-out faces be aligned with each other?

Part 2

Separate the dataset into three non-overlapping parts: the <strong>training set </strong>(100 face images per actor), the <strong>validation set </strong>(10 face images per actor), and the <strong>test set </strong>(10 face images per actor). For the report, describe how you did that. (Any method is fine). The training set will contain faces whose labels you assume you know. The test set and the validation set will contain faces whose labels you pretend to not know and will attempt to determine using the data in the training set.

Part 3

Use Linear Regression in order to build a classifier to distinguish pictures of Bill Hader form pictures of Steve Carell. In your report, specify which cost function you minimized. Report the values of the cost function on the training and the validation sets. Report the performance of the classifier (i.e., the percentage of images that were correctly classified) on the training and the validation sets.

In your report, include the code of the function that you used to compute the output of the classifier (i.e., either Steve Carell or Bill Hader).

In your report, describe what you had to do in order to make the system to work. For example, the system would not work if the parameter $alpha$ is too large. Describe what happens if $alpha$ is too large, and how you figure out what to set $alpha$ too. Describe the other choices that you made in order to make the algorithm work.

<h2>Part 4</h2>

In Part 3, you used the hypothesis function $h_theta (x) = theta_0 + theta_1 x_1 + … + theta_n x_n$ . If $(x_1, …, x_n)$ represents a flattened image, then $(theta_1, …, theta_n)$ can also be viewed as an image. Display the $theta$ s that you obtain by training using the full training dataset, and by training using a training set that contains only two images of each actor.

The images could look as follows.

<h2>Part 5</h2>

In this part, you will demonstrate overfitting. Build classifiers that classify the actors as male or female using the training set with the actors from

<h2>Part 6</h2>

Now, consider a different way of classifying inputs. Instead of assigning the output value $y=1$ to images of Paul McCartney and the output value $y = -1$ to images of John Lennon, which would not generalize to more than 2 labels, we could assign output values as follows:

The output could still be computed using $theta^T x$ , but $theta$ would now have to be a $ntimes k$ matrix, where $k$ is the number of possible labels, with $x$ being a $ntimes 1$ vector.

The cost function would still be the sum of squared differences between the expected outputs and the actual outputs:




Part 6(a)

Compute $partial J/partial theta_{pq}.$ Show your work. Images of <strong>neatly </strong>hand-written derivations are acceptable, though you are encouraged to use LaTeX.

<h3>Part 6(b)</h3>

Show, by referring to Part 6(a), that the derivative of $J(theta)$ with respect to all the components of $theta$ can be written in matrix form as

2X(θTX − Y)T .

Specify the dimensions of each matrix that you are using, and define each variable (e.g., we defined $m$ as the number of training examples.) $X$ is a matrix that contains all the input training data (and additional 1’s), of the appropriate dimensions.

<strong>Part 6(c) </strong>

Implement the cost function from Part 6 and the vectorized gradient function in Python. Include the code in your report.

<h3>Part 6(d)</h3>

Demonstrate that the vectorized gradient function works by computing several components of the gradient using finite differences. In your report, include the code that you used to compute the gradient components using finite differences, and to compare them to the gradient that you computed using your function

Part 7

Run gradient descent on the set of six actors act in order to perform face recognition. Report the performance you obtained on the training and validation sets. Indicate what parameters you chose for gradient descent and why they seem to make sense.

Part 8

Visualize the $theta$ s that you obtained. Note that if $theta$ is a $ktimes n$ matrix, where $k$ is the number of possible labels and $n-1$ is the number of pixels in each image, the rows of $theta$ could be visualized as images. Your outputs could look something like the ones below. Label the images with the appropriate actor names.
